# Fork for Kodi Matrix
I only updated this to not need the old python so I could use this on my Linux Kodi

# Kodi Attract-Mode Launcher (unofficial)
Add-on for Kodi to launch Attract-Mode on Windows and Linux
Prerequisites: Kodi v17 (Krypton) or later.


## Kodi
Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation, a non-profit technology consortium. Kodi is available for multiple operating systems and hardware platforms, with a software 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls

## Attract-Mode Front End
Attract-Mode is a graphical frontend for command line emulators such as MAME, MESS and Nestopia. It hides the underlying operating system and is intended to be controlled with a joystick, gamepad or spin dial, making it ideal for use in arcade cabinets. Attract-Mode is open source and runs on Linux, OS X and Windows-based systems.

### Installation
#### Steps

1. Download the Addon:
For now this Addon is not registered on any official or unofficial Kodi repositories yet, hopefully it would be in the future. For now the way to install this Addon is to install it from a zip file.
Go to this page https://github.com/mkreafle/kodi-attract-mode-launcher/releases and download the latest zip file available.

2. Start Kodi and navigate to Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on browser -> Install from zip file, on the file browser look for the zip file you downloaded on the previous step and select it. Installation is going to start and Kodi will show a notification when this is done.
Note: If preference is not checked, Kodi will ask you to allow installations from zip files as a security measure. Change your preferences to allow installations from zip files and continue with the installation. Also please notice that this options can be displayed on different paths depending of the Skin you are using. The path used above is a generic one that may or may not be on your Skins, but in any case it is not hard to find.

3. Once the Addon is installed, navigate to "Program Add-ons" and you will see Attract-Mode listed there.
